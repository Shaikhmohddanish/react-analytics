# Dealer Analytics Page Performance Optimizations

## Summary of Optimizations

### 1. LazyChartWrapper Component
Created a new LazyChartWrapper component in `components/ui/lazy-chart-wrapper.tsx` that:
- Uses IntersectionObserver API to detect when charts enter the viewport
- Only renders charts when they become visible
- Provides loading indicators for better user experience
- Helps improve initial page load time and memory usage

### 2. Chart Optimizations in dealer-analytics/page.tsx
Successfully optimized the two main charts:
- Optimized the Sales Performance bar chart with LazyChartWrapper
- Optimized the Growth vs Sales scatter chart with LazyChartWrapper

### 3. Implementation Details
The optimized charts now:
- Only render when they enter the viewport (or get close to it)
- Display a loading indicator until fully rendered
- Maintain the same visual appearance and functionality
- Reduce memory usage and improve page performance

### 4. Benefits
- **Reduced Initial Load Time**: Charts are only rendered when needed
- **Improved Memory Usage**: Fewer DOM nodes and JavaScript objects in memory
- **Better User Experience**: Smoother scrolling and page interaction
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicators for charts not yet rendered

### 5. Usage Instructions
To use the LazyChartWrapper component for other charts:

```tsx
import { LazyChartWrapper } from "@/components/ui/lazy-chart-wrapper";

// Then in your component:
<LazyChartWrapper
  data={yourData}
  title="Chart Title"
  height={300} // Set an appropriate height
  renderChart={({ data, height }) => (
    <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={height}>
      {/* Your chart implementation */}
      <YourChartComponent data={data}>
        {/* Chart elements */}
      </YourChartComponent>
    </ResponsiveContainer>
  )}
/>
```

### 6. Next Steps
- Apply LazyChartWrapper to all other charts in the application
- Consider implementing code-splitting for chart libraries
- Add performance monitoring to measure the impact of these optimizations
- Apply similar patterns to other heavy components like data tables
